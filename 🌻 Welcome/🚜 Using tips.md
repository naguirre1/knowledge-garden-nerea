 - Obsidian language is [markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Basic+formatting+syntax) check the linked official site.
 - There are two folders: **🌱 Seedling** and **🌳 Forest** which main purpose is to store knowledge, on an eraly step when you're just gathering info it can go on **🌱 Seedling**, the note will be con status #triage and when is more linked and well formed (no need to be **finished**) it can be moved to **🌳 Forest**a and the status will be changed to #done.
 - **Todo lists:** Every list you create with checkboxes on a note tagged with  #todo-list, will be showed on [[⏰ ToDo Lists]] note, this is done thanks to [dataview plugin](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview). 
	 - [ ] To do example
- **Daily notes:**  [[📆 Daily notes setup]]
- **Emojis:** You can also open an emoji toolbar with a hotkey. For that purpose you'll need *Emoji Toolbar* community plugin ([[🔌 Plugins]]). To use it, enable it and the go to `Obsidian > preferences > hotkeys` and search for "Emoji Toolbar: Open emoji picker" and then click on + and choose your favourite hotkey for this purpose.
- **New basic note:** We can create a shortcut for basics notes creation on `Obsidian > Preferences > Community plugins > Templater`. As far as I know this feature has a gap and you have to manually create a new note and then push the hotkey you selected and the template will be applied.

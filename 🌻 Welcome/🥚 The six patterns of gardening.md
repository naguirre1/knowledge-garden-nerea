# Appleton, Maggie - The Six Patterns of Gardening

Maggie Appleton outlines some main patterns of digital gardening  [_A Brief History and Ethos of the Digital Garden_](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

1. **Topography over timelines** -> On digital gardens the connections and links between notes is the key, not the timeline.
2. **Continuous growth** -> Gardens are always growing. See [[✨ Evergreen notes are always evolving]].
3. **Imperfection and Learning in public** -> Gardens are imperfect by design, since notes are never finished. Always growing remember? 
4. **Playful, personal and experimental**.
5. **Intercropping and content diversity** -> Not limited to words, this is not paper. Digital gardens can include other media, like audio, illustrations, etc.
6. **Independent ownership** -> Gardens should be future-proof and not dependant on stuff that maybe tomorrow could be removed. (i.e. social media picture).

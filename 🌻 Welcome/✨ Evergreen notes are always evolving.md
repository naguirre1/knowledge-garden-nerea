Evergreen refers to notes that are continuously evolving and accumulating value.

- Evergreen notes are concept-oriented and atomic.
- Evergreen notes are densely linked.
- Evergreen notes are written with our own words.
- Evergreen notes are made, not taken.

Some of the advantages of this type of notes include:

- Easy retrieval, since they are about a single concept.
- Enabling forming new ideas and find connections by serendipity, since they are densely linked.

I first learned of this concept from [Andy's Working Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes).

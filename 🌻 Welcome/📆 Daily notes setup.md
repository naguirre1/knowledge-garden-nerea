- First, you might want to set up the daily notes plugin. So go to `Obsidian > Preferences > Core Plugins  > Daily notes` and set your desired date format, the location where you'd like to have all your notes i.e. 📅 Journal. Finally,  on the template file location choose `Templates > 🗓 Daily Note`, this last config will create all daily notes following what you have on your `Templates > 🗓 Daily Note` which you can edit and customize as much as you want.
- Go to the left pane and click on ![[dailyicon.png]] icon. If you don't like the template, just go 📆o `Templates > Daily Note` and change whatever you consider.

- You can also go to `Obsidian > Preferences > Hotkeys` and set the desired hotkey for daily note creation, this way you can avoid the previously described step.

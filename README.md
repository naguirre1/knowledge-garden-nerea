Welcome to digital garden vault. The first idea and steps of this vault was based on [Belén Aldueza's GitHub vault](https://github.com/belen-albeza/obsidian-starter-vault). 

To start using this vault just download the whole folder and initialize Obsidian. A dialog to choose the vault will open so you just have to select `Open Folder as Vault` and select the downloaded root directory.

As I mentioned, this vault is strongly based on Belén vault for starters and therefore I'm dropping some of her sources here together with some [[👩‍🌾 Digital gardeners|others]]. I encourage you to go through it so you can understand the basis of digital gardening.
 [[🥚 The six patterns of gardening]]. 

## Customization

After a little reading, you can go with some awesome customization, Obsidian has a massive amount of [[🌻 Welcome/🔌 Plugins]] you can try. Also you can check `Obsidian > Preferences > Appearance > Themes` to customize the editor appearance.
